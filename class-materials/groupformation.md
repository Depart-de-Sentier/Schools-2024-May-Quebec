# Group Formation ("Vote!")

We have drowned you in theoretical knowledge and source code (sorry). \
Now it is time to apply it!

Remember: In the [Brightway](https://docs.brightway.dev/en/latest/) and [Premise](https://premise.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) ecosystem, you have tools available for:

 - cloud calculations
 - uncertainty and sensitivity assessment
 - parametric modelling
 - interfaces to external models
 - inclusion of spatial and temporal information
 - generation of new databases for scenarios and prospective LCA
 - hybridization of multiple databases
 - database modelling perspectives

If you want, you can even create a standalone interactive online visualization tool with [HoloViz Panel](https://panel.holoviz.org).
